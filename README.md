[00:25.26] Wo, are we movin' too slow?
[00:30.99] Have you seen us
[00:33.92] Uncle Remus
[00:37.58] We look pretty sharp in these clothes (yes, we do)
[01:02.58] 
[00:43.58] Unless we get sprayed with a hose
[00:49.06] It ain't bad in the day
[00:52.33] If they squirt it your way
[00:55.93] 'Cept in the winter, when it's froze
[01:13.93] 
[01:01.44] An' it's hard if it hits
[01:03.87] On yer nose
[01:06.55] On yer nose
[01:12.05] 
[01:28.99] Just keep yer nose
[01:31.38] To the grindstone, they say
[01:34.33] Will that redeem us
[01:37.56] Uncle Remus
[01:43.06] 
[01:40.70] I can't wait till my Fro is full-grown
[01:46.27] I'll just throw 'way my Doo-Rag at home
[01:52.28] I'll take a drive to Beverly Hills
[01:56.21] Just before dawn
[02:04.21] 
[01:59.07] An' knock the little jockeys
[02:02.20] Off the rich people's lawn
[02:04.65] An' before they get up
[02:06.94] I'll be gone, I'll be gone
[02:19.94] 
[02:10.85] Before they get up
[02:12.97] I'll be knocking the jockeys off the lawn
[02:17.27] Down in the dew
